Please be aware that by the end of this month, I will no longer be further developing or providing updates to ArkOS for the 351P/M.  While on the surface, the unit has some nice features, the internal design choices made by Anbernic (mostly with their decision to use an internal USB game controller) for this SOC have proved to be problematic for ongoing support than I care to continue to try to resolve or continue to workaround in ArkOS for this device.  I will continue to develop and update ArkOS for the OGA 1.0, OGA 1.1(BE), RGB10, and the RK2020.  I will deliver ArkOS for the 351V as it’s mostly done, ~~however, it will just be one version that I do not plan to develop or update further once testing is complete and a final image is made available~~.  I will create a final image for the 351 P/M by the the end of the month as well that will include all online updates that were made available up to that point.

While I feel ArkOS for the 351P/M in it’s current form will suffice for the devices capability for sometime, if you’d like to see further development for this unit, checkout 351Elec, Batocera, or TheRA.

Thanks to the community for the support of making ArkOS what it is today.

I've decided that development of ArkOS for the RG351V will continue because the device has proven to be more stable than the RG351P/M and adds some nice features not currently available on other supported devices such as the dual SD card slot, 4:3 screen, and 640x480 resolution.

As I believe we’ve squeezed as much performance out of this chipset with the current Linux kernel available, ArkOS updates will most likely be coming out slower than on a monthly basis.  There’s work being done by other community members to bring mainline Linux kernel support to the rk3326 chipset.  If and when that brings notable improvements to the gaming experience on this chipset, I will provide ArkOS updates to that new kernel.  Until then, I will mostly be updating existing standalone emulators, Retroarch and Retroarch cores from time to time.  

Thanks and enjoy!
