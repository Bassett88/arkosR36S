Known issues with ArkOS, devices and/or various software packages:

1. Putting the unit to sleep while in the following emulators, games or applications is known to not function correctly:
    - **Drastic (Nintendo DS Emulator)** - No controls on resume from sleep.  This is a known issue with the emulator.  Unfortunately, this can't be addressed until the emulator's code is made available.  At the time of this writing, (12/29/2020), the emulator is closed source.
    - **Pico-8** -  If you put the unit to sleep twice while this emulator is in use, there will be no controls on resume.  You can hit start+select to exit and restart the emulator.  Lexaloffle plans to address this concern with a future update to their pico-8 raspberry pi files.
    - **File Manager (Dingux Commander)** - No controls on resume from sleep.  No solution on a possible resolve for this at this time.  If you're technically inclined, you're welcome to review the source code [here](https://github.com/christianhaitian/rs97-commander-sdl2) and provide a solution to the issue.  

2. With the RG351P, when you plug in wifi, keyboard, or any other usb device and attempt to charge the unit at the same time, wifi stops working and the unit may freeze.
    - This is a known hardware issue with the RG351P that software can not fix.  The issue seems to be related to the RG351P missing some noise filtering components on the usb-c ports.  At this time, the best solution is to not use wifi and charge the device at the same time.  You can only do one or the other.  The issue is also not consistent from unit to unit.  Some have reported success with plugging in their charger before booting the device, then plugging in their usb device afterwards.  some don't have the issue at all.  It seems very hit or miss.

3. The battery life indicator is weird.  When the battery life is low and I plugin my charger, the battery indicator almost immediately shows 100 percent.  
   - This is due missing or inaccurate power management integrated circuit (pmic).  All rk3326 device (such as the rg351p, rk2020, and rgb10) except for the Odroid Go Advance suffer this issue.  Because of this, software is used to best judge available power based on voltage from the battery.  Thus when the battery is being charged, the software will see that voltage going into the battery and it assumes it's 100 percent.

4. I'm on Windows 10 version 1703 or newer and I can't see the EASYROMS folder when I plug my micro sd card into my computer.
   - If you don't see a drive letter named EASYROMS when you plug the SD card into a card reader, it's most likely that Windows did not automatically assign a drive letter to that partition on your SD card. This can be resolved by going to disk management (type disk management in the search bar in Windows 10 and select the first control panel app that comes up at the top as the best match), then going to the SD card with the EASYROMS partition label, then assign a drive letter to the EASYROMS partition by right clicking on the EASYROMS partition and selecting Assign Drive Letter or Change Driver letter and Path, then follow the directions from there. Once completed, the drive should show up under My Computer. You typically only need to ever do this once on the Windows machine.

5. The brightness controls in the start menu>display section go down by 1 percent from where you set it when you leave the menu.
   - ~~This is a known issue with emulationstation that's been in existence for awhile.  No solution on a possible resolve for this at this time.  It's recommended to use the global hotkey (R3+Dpad Up or Dpad Down for the RG351P) for controlling brightness instead.  Additional hot key information is available the Frequently Asked Questions section for the [RG351P](https://github.com/christianhaitian/arkos/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions---RG351P#q-what-are-the-global-event-keys-and-emulator-event-keys-in-ArkOS), [RGB10/OGA 1.1](https://github.com/christianhaitian/arkos/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions---RGB10#q-what-are-the-global-event-keys-and-emulator-event-keys-in-ArkOS), and [RK2020/OGA 1.0](https://github.com/christianhaitian/arkos/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions---RK2020#q-what-are-the-global-event-keys-and-emulator-event-keys-in-ArkOS).  If you're technically inclined, you're welcome to review the source code [here](https://github.com/christianhaitian/EmulationStation-fcamod) and provide a solution to the issue.~~ Resolved as of 01/02/2021 Online update.

6. While updating ArkOS, my wifi seems to stop working.
   - This is a common issue that is happening with rtl8xxxu chipset based wifi adapters.  These wifi adapters are known to have bad stability and performance with Linux using the built-in kernel drivers for this chipset.  There is a workaround for the issue available [here](https://github.com/christianhaitian/arkos/issues/124#issuecomment-751475195).

7. OpenTyrian is jerky.  How can this be fixed?
   - This is an issue due to the refresh rate that the game supports versus what the LCD panels on our devices expect.  Unless the developer of OpenTyrian or some other developer can fix the code in OpenTyrian to accommodate smooth play on the LCD panels on this device, this is how this game will perform for now.
