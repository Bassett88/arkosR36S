## Q. How do I configure my wifi connection in ArkOS?
### A. Please note that it is highly recommended that you use the ArkOS 1.2 image or newer that was made available on 11/21/2020 due to wifi fixes that were implemented.  You must have a compatible USB wifi dongle plugged in.  See [this link](https://github.com/retrogamehandheld/oga/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#what-wifi-adapters-work) for a compatible list of USB wifi dongles.  You then will need to do the following:
- Go to the **Options** menu and select **WIFI**.  
- Then hit the **R1** button to go to the **+** sign and click the A button to add your wifi details.  
- Once completed, you can then verify that your wifi is connected by confirming that you see the wifi symbol located near the top right corner of the Emulationstation Menu.  You can also verify that you have a valid wireless connection by going to **Options** then **NETWORK INFO** and verify you have an assigned IP for your device.  

## Q. How do I SSH into ArkOS?
### A. Verify that you completed the steps in [FAQ #1](https://github.com/christianhaitian/arkos/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions---RG351P#q-how-do-i-configure-my-wifi-connection-in-arkos) above to configure your wireless connection.  You will then need to do the following:
- Go to the **Options** menu and select **NETWORK INFO** so you can see your the assigned IP to your device.  
  -  _Be aware that the assigned IP address will show a slash then a number (most likely a 24).  That just represents the network block size, not the ssh port number._  The default ssh port number is 22.  
- Click A to continue and you will go back out to the Options menu.
- Select **Enable Remote Services** so that SSH is enabled before attempting to connect.  
- User and Password credentials are ark/ark.
  -  _Be aware that every time you'd like to access ArkOS on your device from your network, you will need to **Enable Remote Services** after every reboot._  This is a security feature as it's not good security practice to keep remote services active on your device especially when connecting to unknown networks.  It also reduces resource overhead for the system to help ensure the best possible gaming experience.

## Q. I was using Paragon software to add, remove, or modify files on the SD card and now my unit won't boot with the card.  What could be wrong?
### A. The most probable issue is a corrupted ext4 partition on the SD card.  There's been a common occurrence of Paragon corrupting the ext4 partition on SD cards.  It's best to use a Linux machine (or a Linux VM) to manage files on the ext4 partition of the SD card.  You can try to fix the ext4 partition by following the steps in [this link](https://www.platfrastructure.life/post/rpi_boot_repair/), or simply reimage the card.  The [ArkOS](https://github.com/christianhaitian/arkos/wiki) image linked from this wiki provides an exfat partition for the Roms and Bios folder that is easily accessible from Linux, Mac or Windows without any additional software and is easier for managing such files as you don't have to have a Linux machine or VM.

 ### The other possible issues are:
  - The SD card itself is bad.  The original SD card that comes with these units are of unknown quality and are most likely low quality.  
  - The SD card reader on your unit may be bad.  At which point, you would need to repair, replace, or return the unit.

## Q. How can I make text look better in certain games and systems?
### A. Try turning on the RGA Scaling feature.  There is a small difference from Bilinear filtering in that this feature does subpixel scaling instead of just smoothing (may look blurry) as bilinear filtering does.  This feature can be turned on while in game by going to the retroarch menu, then settings, then video, then scrolling down to the RGA Scaling option and hit A to turn it on.  The screen will blank for a few seconds and come back.  See if it improves the picture for you.

## Q. What are the global event keys and emulator event keys in ArkOS?
### A. ![](https://github.com/christianhaitian/arkos/raw/main/devices/rg351p_hotkeys_resized.jpg)  
  - Be aware that there's a known issue with retroarch in which using the menu combination key of Select+X to close the menu while in game may cause the retroarch hotkeys to stop functioning.  This is caused by an issue in which the search box may come up in the menu but is hidden because the retroarch menu disappears as you go back to the game.  The  workaround available is that you can hit L1+R1+Start+Select to open the menu and exit the search dialog with the start button in order to restore the retroarch hotkeys.  Select+X function will return.  More information about this issue available from this libretro forum [link](https://forums.libretro.com/t/rare-hotkey-issue-on-windows-10-retroarch-pc/21311/3).

## Q. How do i scrape roms using screenscraper in ArkOS?
### A. You'll need a screenscraper.fr account.  You can register for a free account at https://www.screenscraper.fr/.  Once you've completed that, enter your username and password that you created at the website in the screenscraper es menu then scrape away!  Note that if you pay for extra threads, it will increase the speed of scraping.  This is useful if you have a large rom collection.

## Q. Where can I find information on where to load roms, available cores, and port information for ArkOS?
### A. Check this [link](https://github.com/christianhaitian/arkos/wiki/ArkOS-Emulators-and-Ports-information) for more info.

## Q. I can't seem to insert coins in some MAME and CPS games.  How do I fix this?

- Launch the MAME or CPS game that's having the coin issue.
- Go into the retroarch menu by hitting Minus+X.  
- Then go to Controls.
- Then go to Port 1 Controls.
- Select an alternate coin button.
   - You can save this setting by going back to the controls menu and selecting one of the 3 save options.
- Hit Select+X to exit the retroarch menu or hit the B button to go back and hit the resume option.

## Q. Can the mouse pointer that's always visible in the upper right corner of Drastic (NDS Emulator) be removed?
### A. As of the writing of this entry (11/10/2020), it can not be removed.  It’s unfortunately a "feature" of the emulator for the time being.

## Q. My unit doesn't seem to boot from the SD card anymore.  What could be the issue?
### A. It could be one of the following issues:

   * It could be either your SD card is corrupted, failing, or has failed.  It is recommended that you use a good name brand SD card such as Sandisk, Samsung, or PNY.  For a dependable list of good name brand cards, please check this [link](https://www.techradar.com/news/best-sd-and-microsd-memory-cards).  Make sure to buy your SD cards from a trusted retail source.  In the United States of America, Wal-Mart, Best Buy, and Target are good sources.  Online, SD cards shipped and sold by Amazon are best.  Example of such is in this [link](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Electronics-microSDXC-Adapter-MB-ME256HA/dp/B08879MG33/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=evo%2Bselect&qid=1596658478&sr=8-1&th=1)
   * It could be that you're unit's battery is low on charge and you need to charge it.  Make sure you let it completely charge.  
   * It could be that the unit's battery is bad.  The included stock battery is of low quality and doesn't maintain battery life consistently among sold units.  
   * It could be that your unit has suffered a component failure failure.  At this point, you'll need to contact rkconsole.com for the original seller you purchased the unit from for further assistance for a replacement or refund if available.

## Q. How can I access a terminal physically on ArkOS
### A. Do the following:

   *  Plug in your usb keyboard.
   *  Exit EmulationStation by hitting Start, then Quit, then Quit Emulationstation.
   *  On your connected usb keyboard, hit alt-f2.
   *  You should now have a terminal login screen appear on the screen.  User: ark Password: ark
   *  If you'd like to go back to EmulationStation without restarting, do the following: `sudo systemctl restart emulationstation`

## Q. When I'm in a game, I go to the retroarch menu and make a change and when I attempt to save the current configuration, it fails to save.  Why is that happening?
### A. The most likely cause is that you have saved a core, content, or game override for the particular emulator core or game you currently have loaded.  Once you have those, you will no longer be able to save a global configuration from that emulator core or game.  This is by design from libretro.  What you'll have to do is from within Emulationstation, scroll through the systems to the retroarch menu, then select either retroarch or retroarch32, then make your global changes there and save current configuration there.

## Q. How do I add and enable background music in ArkOS?
### A. Do the following:

   *  Just pop the micro SD card into a card reader, plug it into your Windows 10 1703, Mac OS X, or Linux computer and look for the drive letter named EASYROMS.
   *  Place all .mp3 files you'd like to use as background music in the roms(EASYROMS)/bgmusic folder on the exfat partition.
   *  Safely eject your micro SD card from your computer and insert the micro SD card in your RG351P and turn it on.
   *  In Emulationstation, press START then go to Sound Settings > Frontend Music > ON.
   *  Go back out of the start menu and enjoy!
