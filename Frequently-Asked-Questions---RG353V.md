## Q. How do I configure my wifi connection in ArkOS?
### A. Do the following:
- Go to the **Options** menu and select **WIFI**.  
- Then click the A button on **Connect to new Wifi connection" to select your ssid and provide your credentials.
- Once completed, you can then verify that your wifi is connected by pressing the start button and reviewing the **SSID:** info at the bottom of the menu.  You can also verify that you have a valid wireless connection by pressing start and looking at the bottom of menu next to **Distro Version**.

**Note:** If you have a password that has special characters not available through the Wifi menu option in the Options menu, you can configure your wifi device using Retroarch in the Settings>Wifi section or by doing one of the options below:

### Manual option 1
At boot, ArkOS will check for a wifikeyfile.txt file in the roms/tools folder (or roms2/tools folder for 2 sd card setups) and start a wifi credentials importing process.  
format is 
```
ssid="your ssid"
pass="your ssid password"
```
Upon successful connection, the file gets deleted for security purposes.

### Manual option 2


1. Press **Start**, scroll down to **Quit**, then select **Quit Emulationstation**.
2. Connect a USB keyboard to your device and press **ALT+F2**.
3. Login using the username of **ark** and password of **ark**.
4. Then type **sudo systemctl stop networkwatchdaemon**
5. Then type **sudo systemctl start NetworkManager**
6. Then type **nmtui** to launch the graphical text based Network Manager utility.
7. Click on **Edit a connection** then Add and follow the menu for configuring your connection.
   - For more information on how to use this utility, check out the article available through this [link](https://www.tecmint.com/nmtui-configure-network-connection/)
   - Configured network connections are stored in /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/
8. Then type **sudo systemctl stop NetworkManager**
9. Then type **sudo systemctl start networkwatchdaemon**

## Q. How do I SSH into ArkOS?
### A. Verify that you completed the steps in [FAQ #1](https://github.com/christianhaitian/arkos/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions---rg353v#q-how-do-i-configure-my-wifi-connection-in-arkos) above to configure your wireless connection.  You will then need to do the following:
- Press start to see your the assigned IP to your device.  
  -  The default ssh port number is 22.  
- Select **Enable Remote Services** from the **Options** menu so that SSH is enabled before attempting to connect.  
- User and Password credentials are ark/ark.
  -  _Be aware that every time you'd like to access ArkOS on your device from your network, you will need to **Enable Remote Services** after every reboot._  This is a security feature as it's not good security practice to keep remote services active on your device especially when connecting to unknown networks.  It also reduces resource overhead for the system to help ensure the best possible gaming experience.
  -  If you'd like for ssh to always remain enabled, just type ```sudo systemctl enable ssh``` from within a ssh or terminal session.
  -  To enable the ability to login as root, do the following while in a ssh or terminal session:
     1. Set a password for the root user by doing ```sudo passwd root``` and set your preferred root password following the instructions presented.
     1. Allow root to be able to login through ssh by doing ```sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config``` then scroll down to ```PermitRootLogin``` and remove the beginning hashtag (#) and set PermitRootLogin to yes.  Basically it should say ```PermitRootLogin yes``` on that line.  
     1. Hit Ctrl+X, then hit y to save the change.
     1. Then either restart ssh by typing in ```sudo systemctl restart ssh``` or restart ArkOS.
- If you'd like to enable authorized key based login, do the following from the ssh terminal session:
   - `sudo chmod -R 755 /home/ark`
   - `mkdir -p ~/.ssh && touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
   - `chmod 700 ~/.ssh && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
   - Create and/or copy your public key to the `/home/ark/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.  See this [link](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/putty/windows/puttygen#creating-a-new-key-pair-for-authentication) for help on how to accomplish this if needed.

**With great power comes great responsibility!**  Be careful as you make changes as now you can easily make various changes that can render the OS unstable or unbootable.

## Q. I was using Paragon software to add, remove, or modify files on the SD card and now my unit won't boot with the card.  What could be wrong?
### A. The most probable issue is a corrupted ext4 partition on the SD card.  There's been a common occurrence of Paragon corrupting the ext4 partition on SD cards.  It's best to use a Linux machine (or a Linux VM) to manage files on the ext4 partition of the SD card.  You can try to fix the ext4 partition by following the steps in [this link](https://www.platfrastructure.life/post/rpi_boot_repair/), or simply reimage the card.  The [ArkOS](https://github.com/christianhaitian/arkos/wiki) image linked from this wiki provides an exfat partition for the Roms and Bios folder that is easily accessible from Linux, Mac or Windows without any additional software and is easier for managing such files as you don't have to have a Linux machine or VM.

 ### The other possible issues are:
  - The SD card itself is bad.  The original SD card that comes with these units are of unknown quality and are most likely low quality.  
  - The SD card reader on your unit may be bad.  At which point, you would need to repair, replace, or return the unit.

## Q. How can I make text look better in certain games and systems?
### A. Try turning on the RGA Scaling feature.  There is a small difference from Bilinear filtering in that this feature does subpixel scaling instead of just smoothing (may look blurry) as bilinear filtering does.  This feature can be turned on while in game by going to the retroarch menu, then settings, then video, then scrolling down to the RGA Scaling option and hit A to turn it on.  The screen will blank for a few seconds and come back.  See if it improves the picture for you.

## Q. How do i scrape roms using screenscraper in ArkOS?
### A. You'll need a screenscraper.fr account.  You can register for a free account at https://www.screenscraper.fr/.  Once you've completed that, enter your username and password that you created at the website in the screenscraper es menu then scrape away!  Note that if you pay for extra threads, it will increase the speed of scraping.  This is useful if you have a large rom collection.

## Q. Where can I find information on where to load roms, available cores, and port information for ArkOS?
### A. Check this [link](https://github.com/christianhaitian/arkos/wiki/ArkOS-Emulators-and-Ports-information) for more info.

## Q. I can't seem to insert coins in some MAME and CPS games.  How do I fix this?
### A. For some reason, select for credit doesn’t work for some games in MAME and CPS.  If you change the coin button to something else like R2 or L2, it works.  Below are the instructions you can follow to do this:

- Launch the MAME or CPS game that's having the coin issue.
- Go into the retroarch menu by hitting Select+X.  
- Then go to Controls.

- Select an alternate coin button.
   - You can save this setting by going back to the controls menu and selecting one of the 3 save options.
- Hit Select+X to exit the retroarch menu or hit the B button to go back and hit the resume option.

## Q. Can the mouse pointer that's always visible in the upper right corner of Drastic (NDS Emulator) be removed?
### A. ~~As of the writing of this entry (11/10/2020), it can not be removed.  It’s unfortunately a "feature" of the emulator for the time being.~~ Resolved as of the 1/28/2021 update.

## Q. My unit doesn't seem to boot from the SD card anymore.  What could be the issue?
### A. It could be one of the following issues:

   * It could be either your SD card is corrupted, failing, or has failed.  It is recommended that you use a good name brand SD card such as Sandisk, Samsung, or PNY.  For a dependable list of good name brand cards, please check this [link](https://www.techradar.com/news/best-sd-and-microsd-memory-cards).  Make sure to buy your SD cards from a trusted retail source.  In the United States of America, Wal-Mart, Best Buy, and Target are good sources.  Online, SD cards shipped and sold by Amazon are best.  Example of such is in this [link](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Electronics-microSDXC-Adapter-MB-ME256HA/dp/B08879MG33/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=evo%2Bselect&qid=1596658478&sr=8-1&th=1)
   * It could be that you're unit's battery is low on charge and you need to charge it.  Make sure you let it completely charge.  
   * It could be that the unit's battery is bad.  The included stock battery is of low quality and doesn't maintain battery life consistently among sold units.  
   * It could be that your unit has suffered a component failure failure.  At this point, you'll need to contact rkconsole.com for the original seller you purchased the unit from for further assistance for a replacement or refund if available.

## Q. How can I access a terminal physically on ArkOS
### A. Do the following:

   *  Plug in your usb keyboard.
   *  Exit EmulationStation by hitting Start, then Quit, then Quit Emulationstation.
   *  On your connected usb keyboard, hit alt-f2.
   *  You should now have a terminal login screen appear on the screen.  User: ark Password: ark
   *  If you'd like to go back to EmulationStation without restarting, do the following: `sudo systemctl restart emulationstation`

## Q. When I'm in a game, I go to the retroarch menu and make a change and when I attempt to save the current configuration, it fails to save.  Why is that happening?
### A. The most likely cause is that you have saved a core, content, or game override for the particular emulator core or game you currently have loaded.  Once you have those, you will no longer be able to save a global configuration from that emulator core or game.  This is by design from libretro.  What you'll have to do is from within Emulationstation, scroll through the systems to the retroarch menu, then select either retroarch or retroarch32, then make your global changes there and save current configuration there.

## Q. How do I add and enable background music in ArkOS?
### A. Do the following:

   *  Just pop the micro SD card into a card reader, plug it into your Windows 10 1703, Mac OS X, or Linux computer and look for the drive letter named EASYROMS.
   *  Place all .mp3 files you'd like to use as background music in the roms(EASYROMS)/bgmusic folder on the exfat partition.
   *  Safely eject your micro SD card from your computer and insert the micro SD card in your rg353v and turn it on.
   *  In Emulationstation, press START then go to Sound Settings > Frontend Music > ON.
   *  Go back out of the start menu and enjoy!

**Important Note** If your .mp3 music file(s) are not playing, it's mostly likely an issue with the .mp3 files your using.  To test and confirm it works on your installation, try the free public domain one on your unit from the link below.  If it works, then this confirms that the issue is with your .mp3 file(s). This has been a common issue with music downloaded or converted from YouTube.

## Q. Can the power LED be completely turned off via software?
### A. No.  This LED can only be changed from green to red and back again.  It can not be completely turned off via software.

## Q. I've added the roms to the appropriate folder, but once I put the SD card inside the console it doesn't seem to find my roms.
### A. Check the following:
* The roms are in the supported extension for the system per the [Emulators and Ports section](https://github.com/christianhaitian/arkos/wiki/ArkOS-Emulators-and-Ports-information)
* Try pressing start then go to **UI Settings** then **visible systems** and make sure to **select all**.
* Try pressing start then go to **Advanced settings** and be sure **parse gamelists only** is off.

## Q. How do I generate .m3u files for PS1 games in ArkOS?
### A. Do the following:

1. Load all of your ps1 .cue or .chd files into the /roms/psx folder.  
   * Only .cue or .chd files are possible for creating .m3u files in ArkOS!
   * If you wish, you can place your ps1 games within individual sub folders within the /roms/psx folder.  For example, you can put all of your Metal Gear Solid cue/bin or chds within /roms/psx/mgs folder and this tool will still work.
   * Your multi disc games should have the word **Disc** as part of it description in order to properly generate a good m3u file.

2. Go to the Options section in Emulationstation just above Retroarch and select **PS1 - Generate m3u files** and when completed, the screen will show what all m3u files were created.
   * If you add additional multi disc games after running this tool, be sure to go to the Options section in Emulationstation just above Retroarch and select **PS1 - Delete m3u files** and then recreate them.  Failing to do so will create additional entries in existing m3u files that may cause issues.

## Q. I have duplicate games showing for PS1.  How do I eliminate the duplicates?
### A. This is most likely caused by having multiple .cue or .chd files for multi disk games.  Do the following:

1. Be sure to follow the steps [here for generating .m3u files in ArkOS](https://github.com/christianhaitian/arkos/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions---rg353v#q-how-do-i-generate-m3u-files-for-ps1-games-in-arkos)
2. Then go to the Options section in Emulationstation just above Retroarch and select **PS1 - Show only m3u files**.
3. Emulationstation will restart and you should only have single entries for your multi disk games.

## Q. What is BaRT and how do I access it?
### A. BaRT is short for Boot and Recovery Tool.  It allows the following:
* You can switch to a Retroarch only interface on boot.
  * In this mode, no additional tools or standalone emulators are accessible.  This means no NDS, no standalone PSP, no TI99.  To enable remote services, you must do so through BaRT.  To use a File Manager, you must do so through BaRT.  Of course, you can always just switch back to Emulationstation anytime as well and access these standalone emulators and tools.
* If Emulationstation doesn't load due to a bad configuration of the es_systems.cfg file, you can load BaRT and
  * Connect to Wifi
  * Enable remote services to handle recovery tasks,
  * Load 351Files for file management needs
  * Drop into terminal mode by connecting a keyboard and hitting alt+f2.
* To access BaRT, just hold the B button while booting and in a few seconds, you should be presented with the Boot and Recovery Tools screen similar to this: ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/christianhaitian/arkos/main/pics/BaRT.jpg)

## Q. How do I make use of the second sd slot for roms and games?
### A. Do the following:
1. Make sure you have a micro sd card that is preformatted to Exfat, EXT4, Fat, Fat32 or NTFS.
    * For best performance, use EXT4, Exfat or NTFS.
        * **If using EXT4, be sure that permissions for the contents of the second sd card are set to user/group 1002:1002**.  Otherwise, you may experience issues with successfully running games for some systems.
1. Go the Options section just after ScummVM and before Retroarch and click the A button.
2. Click on Advanced.
3. Then click on SWITCH TO SD2 FOR ROMS.
4. If a preformatted micro sd card has been found, it will be mounted and the system will setup the appropriate roms folders on it if they don't exist already.
    * Existing roms folders, roms, bios, and games on this sd card will NOT be overwritten during this process.
    * Once ArkOS is setup to use the second sd slot for roms and games, your main sd card and your roms sd card must be in the unit for ArkOS to boot.
    * This process will NOT copy any of your roms, games and saves from the main SD card to the secondary card.  It will just create the structure for you.  You'll need to copy those yourself.  You can use File Manager from the Options menu to do this or copy them manually from your computer.

## Q. How do I use the HDMI port?
### A. With the unit powered off, plug the device into your HDMI TV or monitor.  Then power the device on.
* You must have a compatible mini HDMI cable.  There have been reports that some HDMI cables don't work correctly with this unit.  Make sure you have one that is relatively new and of known good quality.

## Q. Can I use external controllers with this unit?
### A. Yes.  Bluetooth and USB controllers should work with the unit.  For bluetooth controllers, make sure to go to Bluetooth in the options system section just before Retroarch and run it.  It will start the Bluetooth connection manager.  Put your bluetooth controller into pairing mode and select **Connect to new Bluetooth device** and add your bluetooth device.
**Notes:**
* Be sure Bluetooth is on.  You can confirm bluetooth is on by pressing start and verifying it says BT:On In the status section at the bottom of the menu.  If it says BT:Off, Hold F then hit R3 which should toggle it on.  You can confirm by hitting start twice again To refresh the status area.
* Be sure to setup your external controller in Emulationstation by hitting start then **Configure Input**.  This will allow your external controller to navigate the Emulationstation menu and Retroarch based emulators
* When using an external controller, only Retroarch based emulators will be automatically setup when configured through Emulationstation.  External emulators such as standalone mupen64plus, PPSSPP, and SCUMMVM may need additional manual configuration via SSH.
* With an external controller connected, you can bring up the retroarch menu by pressing select+start+l1+r1.  

## Q. Can I use bluetooth headphones with this unit?
### A. Yes.  Bluetooth headphones should work with the unit as of the ArkOS v2.0 (11/01/2022) updated.  Make sure to go to Bluetooth in the options system section just before Retroarch and run it.  It will start the Bluetooth connection manager.  Put your bluetooth headphones into pairing mode and select **Connect to new Bluetooth device** and add your bluetooth headphones.
**Notes:** 
* Be sure Bluetooth is on.  You can confirm bluetooth is on by pressing start and verifying it says BT:On In the status section at the bottom of the menu.  If it says BT:Off, Hit the F button which should toggle it on.  You can confirm by hitting start twice again To refresh the status area.

**Known issues:**
* The Emulationstation interface needs to be restarted after successfully connecting to bluetooth audio in order for interface sound effects to route via bluetooth.  Just press start, then go to quit, then press A on the Restart Emulationstation menu option.
* ~~Audio from video snapshots and video screensaver does not play when bluetooth audio is connected.~~ Resolved as of 01/03/2023 update.

**Tips:**
* If you're experiencing excessive audio delays (of about 1 second or more) in retroarch based emulators, try reducing the retroarch audio delay configuration by going to retroarch Settings>Audio>Output>Audio Latency (ms).  It's set by default to 128.  You can try reducing that to 64 or another number and see if that helps.

## Q. How do I make American Laser Games, EASYRPG, ScummVM, or Wolfenstein show up in Emulationstation?
### A. Make sure you load the appropriate support files into the respective folders.  See the [Emulators Information](https://github.com/christianhaitian/arkos/wiki/ArkOS-Emulators-and-Ports-information) section for more info.  Then make the system visible from the Emulationstation start menu by pressing the start button, then press the A button on UI Settings, then press the A button on Visible Systems.  Select the systems you want visible by highlighting them then pressing A or scroll to the bottom and press Select All.  Then press the B button then press Start.  The additional systems you selected should now be visible.

## Q. What is Quick Mode and how do I enable it?
### A. When you do a safe shutdown (F button + Power Button) while in a Retroarch or Retroarch32 emulator, an auto savestate will be created of the current game and the unit will shutdown.  Upon power on, the system will autoboot into the last game and resume the auto savestate.  To enable this mode, select Enable Quick Mode from the Options>Advanced menu section in Emulationstation.  **Reminder** - This only works with Retroarch and Retroarch32 based emulators.  As of 9/21/2023, this also works with the Pico-8 standalone emulator as well.  You can boot directly into the last Pico-8 game you were playing or into splore.  Of course, no auto savestate will be available since the emulator doesn't support savestates.

## Q. How do I Host, Join, or Spectate an Adhoc (local) Netplay session?
### A. Make sure you're on the 12/08/2023 or later version of ArkOS.  After you press A to launch an emulator core and game via retroarch or retroarch32 that is compatible with netplay, hold the X button before the game loads.  You should then be presented with an Adhoc Netplay Session Manager menu.
* All supported devices must be on the same version of ArkOS
* Compatible only with Retroarch and Retroarch32 8bit, 16bit, and older Arcade games such as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and The Simpsons
* All supported devices must be using the same version of retroarch and retroarch32 cores.
  * Make sure to update all retroarch and retroarch32 cores
* Game Share mostly works with single game files.  Multi Disc games may or may not work.
* By default, Adhoc Netplay attempts to host sessions via a 5GHz connection for the best experience.  If a host or client has a wireless chip that does not support 5GHz, ensure the host is set to 2.4Ghz mode in the Adhoc Netplay Session Manager Settings menu.
* It can take up to 1-2 minutes for a client or spectator to find the host for an Adhoc NetPlay game session.  Starting the Host session first before attempting to join from a client or spectator can help speed this process up.

## Q.  What is Game Share?
### A.  Game Share allows you to wirelessly share a game with another ArkOS device so you can adhoc netplay with the ArkOS device.  This is handy in case one unit has a game that is wanted to be played via netplay but the other doesn't.  Only works to share the game to one other wirelessly connected device.  This is available from the Adhoc Netplay Session Manager menu.

## Q. How do I use the governor (performance) setting for systems and games?
### A. Make sure you're on the 12/22/2023 or later version of ArkOS to make use of this feature.  The governor setting allows you to control the speed frequency for systems and games.
The available governors are performance, ondemand, and powersave. 

* Performance locks the frequency to the highest setting of the chip.  It also uses the most battery and generates the most heat.
* Ondemand allows the frequency to vary based on the load as sensed by the OS.  It attempts to balance performance and saving on power and heat generation where possible.
* Powersave locks the frequency to a step above the lowest frequency.  This has the best battery life and lowest heat generation but can cause certain systems and games to experience lag especially when certain overlays and shaders are used.

By default the governor for all systems and games is set to performance.  \
Why? Because the 2nd primary goal of the distro is performance.  \
This can be set globally for all systems and games, per system, and per game.  

* To set it globally, press Start then go to Advanced Settings then go to Default Emulator Governor and change it.
* To set it on a per system basis, press Start then go to Emulator Settings, choose the emulator(system),
then go to governor and change it.  
* To set it on a per game basis, go to the system and game, then
press select, then go to edit this game's metadata, then go to governor and change it, then scroll 
to the bottom and scroll to save and press the A button.

Note the hierarchy of the governor settings is as follows:

* Per game takes precedence over emulator and global.
* Per emulator takes precedence over global.

## Q. Can I load ArkOS onto the internal (emmc) storage?
### A. This is possible with a custom image available for the RG353V.  This is only possible with the RG353V unit.  This is not possible with the RG353VS since this unit does not contain internal (emmc) storage.  

**Notes**
 - You must have at least 60 percent battery power available on your unit before the process can start.  It is best to have it fully charged.
 - You must be able to boot ArkOS from an existing sd card installation.
 - You must have at least 8GBs of storage available on your roms partition.  If you're using a 2 sd card setup, you must have at least 8GBs of free space  on the 2nd sd card.
 - This will not work with fat32 formatted sd cards due to the 4GB max singular file size limitation.
 - This is a fresh install of ArkOS onto your internal (emmc).  Many settings and roms will not be transferred using this process except for the following:
   - Display Panel settings such as contrast and saturation
   - Kodi settings and plugins
   - Drastic emulator configuration
   - Most Emulationstation Settings (Some settings may need to be toggled such as preferred verbal warning voice and setting)
   - Wireless internet settings
 - You should be able to do a backup and restore of your existing settings after the initial setup has been completed on your internal emmc storage.
 - If you'd like to load Android back onto the internal memory, check out [GammaOS-RK3566 by TheGammaSqueeze](https://github.com/TheGammaSqueeze/GammaOS-RK3566).
