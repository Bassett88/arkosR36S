Because ArkOS is based on Ubuntu, the operating system is fully read/write.  You can make changes right in the OS and the changes will persist.  \
Have a driver, module, other software you'd like to build or install in ArkOS?  As long as it's aarch64 compatible, you can do this! \
First, you'll need to install the necessary headers and some other build tools for your ArkOS supported device.

See [here](https://github.com/christianhaitian/arkos/blob/main/Headers/README.md) for more info.
