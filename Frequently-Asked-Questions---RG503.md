## Q. How do I configure my wifi connection in ArkOS?
### A. Do the following:
- Go to the **Options** menu and select **WIFI**.  
- Then click the A button on **Connect to new Wifi connection" to select your ssid and provide your credentials.
- Once completed, you can then verify that your wifi is connected by pressing the start button and reviewing the **SSID:** info at the bottom of the menu.  You can also verify that you have a valid wireless connection by pressing start and looking at the bottom of menu next to **Distro Version** or by going to **Options** then **Wifi** then **Current Network Info** and verify you have an assigned IP for your device.

**Note:** If you have a password that has special characters not available through the Wifi menu option in the Options menu, you can configure your wifi device manually by doing the following:

1. Press **Start**, scroll down to **Quit**, then select **Quit Emulationstation**.
2. Connect a USB keyboard to your device and press **ALT+F2**.
3. Login using the username of **ark** and password of **ark**.
4. Then type **sudo systemctl stop networkwatchdaemon**
5. Then type **sudo systemctl start NetworkManager**
6. Then type **nmtui** to launch the graphical text based Network Manager utility.
7. Click on **Edit a connection** then Add and follow the menu for configuring your connection.
   - For more information on how to use this utility, check out the article available through this [link](https://www.tecmint.com/nmtui-configure-network-connection/)
   - Configured network connections are stored in /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/
8. Then type **sudo systemctl stop NetworkManager**
9. Then type **sudo systemctl start networkwatchdaemon**

## Q. How do I SSH into ArkOS?
### A. Verify that you completed the steps in [FAQ #1](https://github.com/christianhaitian/arkos/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions---rg503#q-how-do-i-configure-my-wifi-connection-in-arkos) above to configure your wireless connection.  You will then need to do the following:
- Press start to see your the assigned IP to your device.  
  -  The default ssh port number is 22.  
- Select **Enable Remote Services** from the **Options** menu so that SSH is enabled before attempting to connect.  
- User and Password credentials are ark/ark.
  -  _Be aware that every time you'd like to access ArkOS on your device from your network, you will need to **Enable Remote Services** after every reboot._  This is a security feature as it's not good security practice to keep remote services active on your device especially when connecting to unknown networks.  It also reduces resource overhead for the system to help ensure the best possible gaming experience.
  -  If you'd like for ssh to always remain enabled, just type ```sudo systemctl enable ssh``` from within a ssh or terminal session.
  -  To enable the ability to login as root, do the following while in a ssh or terminal session:
     1. Set a password for the root user by doing ```sudo passwd root``` and set your preferred root password following the instructions presented.
     1. Allow root to be able to login through ssh by doing ```sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config``` then scroll down to ```PermitRootLogin``` and remove the beginning hashtag (#) and set PermitRootLogin to yes.  Basically it should say ```PermitRootLogin yes``` on that line.  
     1. Hit Ctrl+X, then hit y to save the change.
     1. Then either restart ssh by typing in ```sudo systemctl restart ssh``` or restart ArkOS.

**With great power comes great responsibility!**  Be careful as you make changes as now you can easily make various changes that can render the OS unstable or unbootable.

## Q. I was using Paragon software to add, remove, or modify files on the SD card and now my unit won't boot with the card.  What could be wrong?
### A. The most probable issue is a corrupted ext4 partition on the SD card.  There's been a common occurrence of Paragon corrupting the ext4 partition on SD cards.  It's best to use a Linux machine (or a Linux VM) to manage files on the ext4 partition of the SD card.  You can try to fix the ext4 partition by following the steps in [this link](https://www.platfrastructure.life/post/rpi_boot_repair/), or simply reimage the card.  The [ArkOS](https://github.com/christianhaitian/arkos/wiki) image linked from this wiki provides an exfat partition for the Roms and Bios folder that is easily accessible from Linux, Mac or Windows without any additional software and is easier for managing such files as you don't have to have a Linux machine or VM.

 ### The other possible issues are:
  - The SD card itself is bad.  The original SD card that comes with these units are of unknown quality and are most likely low quality.  
  - The SD card reader on your unit may be bad.  At which point, you would need to repair, replace, or return the unit.

## Q. How can I make text look better in certain games and systems?
### A. Try turning on the RGA Scaling feature.  There is a small difference from Bilinear filtering in that this feature does subpixel scaling instead of just smoothing (may look blurry) as bilinear filtering does.  This feature can be turned on while in game by going to the retroarch menu, then settings, then video, then scrolling down to the RGA Scaling option and hit A to turn it on.  The screen will blank for a few seconds and come back.  See if it improves the picture for you.

## Q. Can the mouse pointer that's always visible in the upper right corner of Drastic (NDS Emulator) be removed?
### A. ~~As of the writing of this entry (11/10/2020), it can not be removed.  It’s unfortunately a "feature" of the emulator for the time being.~~ Resolved as of the 1/28/2021 update.

## Q. My unit doesn't seem to boot from the SD card anymore.  What could be the issue?
### A. It could be one of the following issues:

   * It could be either your SD card is corrupted, failing, or has failed.  It is recommended that you use a good name brand SD card such as Sandisk, Samsung, or PNY.  For a dependable list of good name brand cards, please check this [link](https://www.techradar.com/news/best-sd-and-microsd-memory-cards).  Make sure to buy your SD cards from a trusted retail source.  In the United States of America, Wal-Mart, Best Buy, and Target are good sources.  Online, SD cards shipped and sold by Amazon are best.  Example of such is in this [link](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Electronics-microSDXC-Adapter-MB-ME256HA/dp/B08879MG33/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=evo%2Bselect&qid=1596658478&sr=8-1&th=1)
   * It could be that you're unit's battery is low on charge and you need to charge it.  Make sure you let it completely charge.  
   * It could be that the unit's battery is bad.  The included stock battery is of low quality and doesn't maintain battery life consistently among sold units.  
   * It could be that your unit has suffered a component failure failure.  At this point, you'll need to contact rkconsole.com for the original seller you purchased the unit from for further assistance for a replacement or refund if available.

## Q. How can I access a terminal physically on ArkOS
### A. Do the following:

   *  Plug in your usb keyboard.
   *  Exit EmulationStation by hitting Start, then Quit, then Quit Emulationstation.
   *  On your connected usb keyboard, hit alt-f2.
   *  You should now have a terminal login screen appear on the screen.  User: ark Password: ark
   *  If you'd like to go back to EmulationStation without restarting, do the following: `sudo systemctl restart emulationstation`

## Q. When I'm in a game, I go to the retroarch menu and make a change and when I attempt to save the current configuration, it fails to save.  Why is that happening?
### A. The most likely cause is that you have saved a core, content, or game override for the particular emulator core or game you currently have loaded.  Once you have those, you will no longer be able to save a global configuration from that emulator core or game.  This is by design from libretro.  What you'll have to do is from within Emulationstation, scroll through the systems to the retroarch menu, then select either retroarch or retroarch32, then make your global changes there and save current configuration there.

## Q. How do I add and enable background music in ArkOS?
### A. Do the following:

   *  Just pop the micro SD card into a card reader, plug it into your Windows 10 1703, Mac OS X, or Linux computer and look for the drive letter named EASYROMS.
   *  Place all .mp3 files you'd like to use as background music in the roms(EASYROMS)/bgmusic folder on the exfat partition.
   *  Safely eject your micro SD card from your computer and insert the micro SD card in your rg503 and turn it on.
   *  In Emulationstation, press START then go to Sound Settings > Frontend Music > ON.
   *  Go back out of the start menu and enjoy!

**Important Note** If your .mp3 music file(s) are not playing, it's mostly likely an issue with the .mp3 files your using.  To test and confirm it works on your installation, try the free public domain one on your unit from the link below.  If it works, then this confirms that the issue is with your .mp3 file(s). This has been a common issue with music downloaded or converted from YouTube.

## Q. How do I generate .m3u files for PS1 games in ArkOS?
### A. Do the following:

1. Load all of your ps1 .cue or .chd files into the /roms/psx folder.  
   * Only .cue or .chd files are possible for creating .m3u files in ArkOS!
   * If you wish, you can place your ps1 games within individual sub folders within the /roms/psx folder.  For example, you can put all of your Metal Gear Solid cue/bin or chds within /roms/psx/mgs folder and this tool will still work.
   * Your multi disc games should have the word **Disc** as part of it description in order to properly generate a good m3u file.

2. Go to the Options section in Emulationstation just above Retroarch and select **PS1 - Generate m3u files** and when completed, the screen will show what all m3u files were created.
   * If you add additional multi disc games after running this tool, be sure to go to the Options section in Emulationstation just above Retroarch and select **PS1 - Delete m3u files** and then recreate them.  Failing to do so will create additional entries in existing m3u files that may cause issues.

## Q. I have duplicate games showing for PS1.  How do I eliminate the duplicates?
### A. This is most likely caused by having multiple .cue or .chd files for multi disk games.  Do the following:

1. Be sure to follow the steps [here for generating .m3u files in ArkOS](https://github.com/christianhaitian/arkos/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions---rg503#q-how-do-i-generate-m3u-files-for-ps1-games-in-arkos)
2. Then go to the Options section in Emulationstation just above Retroarch and select **PS1 - Show only m3u files**.
3. Emulationstation will restart and you should only have single entries for your multi disk games.

## Q. What is BaRT and how do I access it?
### A. BaRT is short for Boot and Recovery Tool.  It allows the following:
* You can switch to a Retroarch only interface on boot.
  * In this mode, no additional tools or standalone emulators are accessible.  This means no NDS, no standalone PSP, no TI99.  To enable remote services, you must do so through BaRT.  To use a File Manager, you must do so through BaRT.  Of course, you can always just switch back to Emulationstation anytime as well and access these standalone emulators and tools.
* If Emulationstation doesn't load due to a bad configuration of the es_systems.cfg file, you can load BaRT and
  * Connect to Wifi
  * Enable remote services to handle recovery tasks,
  * Load 351Files for file management needs
  * Drop into terminal mode by connecting a keyboard and hitting alt+f2.
* To access BaRT, just hold the B button while booting and in a few seconds, you should be presented with the Boot and Recovery Tools screen similar to this: ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/christianhaitian/arkos/main/pics/BaRT.jpg)

## Q. How do I make use of the second sd slot for roms and games?
### A. Do the following:
1. Make sure you have a micro sd card that is preformatted to Exfat, EXT4, Fat, Fat32 or NTFS.
    * For best performance, use EXT4, Exfat or NTFS.
        * **If using EXT4, be sure that permissions for the contents of the second sd card are set to user/group 1002:1002**.  Otherwise, you may experience issues with successfully running games for some systems.
1. Go the Options section just after ScummVM and before Retroarch and click the A button.
2. Click on Advanced.
3. Then click on SWITCH TO SD2 FOR ROMS.
4. If a preformatted micro sd card has been found, it will be mounted and the system will setup the appropriate roms folders on it if they don't exist already.
    * Existing roms folders, roms, bios, and games on this sd card will NOT be overwritten during this process.
    * Once ArkOS is setup to use the second sd slot for roms and games, your main sd card and your roms sd card must be in the unit for ArkOS to boot.
    * This process will NOT copy any of your roms, games and saves from the main SD card to the secondary card.  It will just create the structure for you.  You'll need to copy those yourself.  You can use File Manager from the Options menu to do this or copy them manually from your computer.

## Q. How do I use the HDMI port?
### A. With the unit powered off, plug the device into your HDMI TV or monitor.  Then power the device on.
* You must have a compatible mini HDMI cable.  There have been reports that some HDMI cables don't work correctly with this unit.  Make sure you have one that is relatively new and of known good quality.

## Q. Can I use external controllers with this unit?
### A. Yes.  Bluetooth and USB controllers should work with the unit.  For bluetooth controllers, make sure to go to Bluetooth in the options system section just before Retroarch and run it.  It will start the Bluetooth connection manager.  Put your bluetooth controller into pairing mode and select **Connect to new Bluetooth device** and add your bluetooth device.
**Notes:** 
* Be sure Bluetooth is on.  You can confirm bluetooth is on by pressing start and verifying it says BT:On In the status section at the bottom of the menu.  If it says BT:Off, Hit the F button which should toggle it on.  You can confirm by hitting start twice again To refresh the status area.
* Be sure to setup your external controller in Emulationstation by hitting start then **Configure Input**.  This will allow your external controller to navigate the Emulationstation menu and Retroarch based emulators
* When using an external controller, only Retroarch based emulators will be automatically setup when configured through Emulationstation.  External emulators such as standalone mupen64plus, PPSSPP, and SCUMMVM may need additional manual configuration via SSH.

## Q. Can I use bluetooth headphones with this unit?
### A. Yes.  Bluetooth headphones should work with the unit as of the ArkOS v2.0 (11/01/2022) updated.  Make sure to go to Bluetooth in the options system section just before Retroarch and run it.  It will start the Bluetooth connection manager.  Put your bluetooth headphones into pairing mode and select **Connect to new Bluetooth device** and add your bluetooth headphones.
**Notes:** 
* Be sure Bluetooth is on.  You can confirm bluetooth is on by pressing start and verifying it says BT:On In the status section at the bottom of the menu.  If it says BT:Off, Hit the F button which should toggle it on.  You can confirm by hitting start twice again To refresh the status area.
**Known issues**
* The Emulationstation interface needs to be restarted after successfully connecting to bluetooth audio in order for interface sound effects to route via bluetooth.  Just press start, then go to quit, then press A on the Restart Emulationstation menu option.
* ~~Audio from video snapshots and video screensaver does not play when bluetooth audio is connected.~~ Resolved as of 01/03/2023 update.
**Tip**
* If you're experiencing excessive audio delays (of about 1 second or more) in retroarch based emulators, try reducing the retroarch audio delay configuration by going to retroarch Settings>Audio>Output>Audio Latency (ms).  It's set by default to 128.  You can try reducing that to 64 or another number and see if that helps.
