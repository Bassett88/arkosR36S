You want more ports?  

Well, I've decided to focus on emulation and not so much on ports due to the following reasons:

1. I'm not really into ports.  A few of them I like are Command Genius, OpenBOR and Doom but most others I don't like.  My main draw is emulation of older classic gaming systems from my youth.  
2. The time to port many of them is more time consuming than I really care to devote to that.
3. I'm not that skilled at converting ports to be compatible with this chipset.
4. Many of them have issues with controls disappearing when resuming from sleep.

So with that, official support of porting any other singular game will not be a focus.  All is not lost though as another community member has stepped up to take on the challenge.  Check out kreal's Anberports [here](https://github.com/krishenriksen/AnberPorts).  Support for those ports are provided directly by kreal and other community members on the RGHandheld discord [here](https://discord.gg/wurh4WM)
