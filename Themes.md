Looking to update the existing ArkOS themes or add others?  

Various themes can be easily added to the roms/themes folder by inserting your micro SD card into a Windows, Mac, or Linux machine.  Just do the following:

1. Simply find a Emulationstation theme you like.  
1. Download the pack.  
1. Add it's root folder to the /roms/themes folder.  
1. Insert the micro sd card back into your unit and boot it up.  
1. Once in Emulationstation, hit the start button, then UI Settings, then Theme and select the theme you just loaded.  It should be named the same as the root folder name you added into your /roms/themes folder.
